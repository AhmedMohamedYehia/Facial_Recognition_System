# Face Recognition Project #

<h1> The project is divided into 4 modules </h1>
<p> The project is built for educational purposes, to learn how to apply feature engineering techniques, so it may be slower or have a lower accuracy than the library functions, but the accuracy is acceptable</p>
<p> <ol>
  <li><h2>Face Detection </h2></li>
  <li><h2>Landmark Detection </h2></li>
  <li><h2>Recognition using Eigen Faces</h2> </li>
  <li><h2>Recognition using Local Binary Pattern Histograms</h2> </li>
  <p>A demo video for the module: https://youtu.be/9adhzAfto0I</p>
  <p>Applying Local Binary Patterns filter to get a LBP image after using the preprocessed grayscale version of the image, applying a histogram comparison to get the closeness of any two images to check the identity of the person</p>
</ol> </p>
